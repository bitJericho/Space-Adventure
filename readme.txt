Directions:

Space Adventure allows you to fly a spaceship around any arbitrary graphic.

Full transparency is not rendered and your ship can fly through it. Create any sort of level your heart desires and fly through it. The maximum size for a level is 2048x2048 pixels unless you modify the code. It may take quite some time to load a large graphic. Please note very large levels may have a lot of gravity and your ship may not be very maneuverable.

To control your spaceship, use the WASD keys.

If you're pro, you can learn to control your thrusters independently. Please see this diagram:

A     D
^     ^

|     |
E     Q

Alternative keys:

4     6
^     ^

 \ 5 /

9     7

This may seem confusing, but you control the ship easily if move the ship like it was in an FPS game.

Escape brings you back to the title screen.
